    "# Introduction to DVC\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to Data Version Control (DVC), a tool essential for data versioning in machine learning. Learners will explore the motivation behind data versioning, understand its differences from code versioning, and experiment with a simple classification problem. They will review basic Git commands, learn about DVC, and practice setting up a repository. The chapter concludes with an overview of DVCâ€™s features and use cases, including versioning data and models, CI/CD for machine learning, experiment tracking, pipelines, and more.\n",

    "## 1.1 Data Versioning Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex.1 - Anatomy of a Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will reinforce your understanding of how data influences the model performance. You will be working with the Airbnb booking dataset (in the file booking.csv). The dataset is suited for classification tasks to predict if someone would cancel a booking. It contains several numerical and categorical columns. You will split the provided dataset into three mutually exclusive samples - train_A.csv, train_B.csv, and test.csv - using split_dataset.py script. Further, for each training dataset, you'll run the data processing and model training pipeline to train a Random Forest Classifier model and test its performance on the test set by using model_training.py. The hyperparameters defined in params.json are consistent in both runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python scripts are designed to accept command line arguments and run via shell. Feel free to explore these scripts to enrich your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruction**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the dataset by running the command `python split_dataset.py booking.csv train_A.csv train_B.csv test.csv` on the editor shell.\n",
    "2. Train and analyze model performance using the first training set by running `python model_training.py <params_file> <training_file> <test_file>` with proper filenames. Take a note of the metrics.\n",
    "3. Train and analyze model performance using the second training set by running `python model_training.py <params_file> <training_file> <test_file>` with proper filenames. Compare the metrics with the previous run."
